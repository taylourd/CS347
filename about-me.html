	<h2> Little tid-bits about me</h2>
	<p>
		My favourite thing to do is think. I love to relax and let my mind wander. I have recently joined the "planner community". I have dedicated myself to putting my plans down on paper and committing myself to them. I also have become big on budgetting. After discovering the methods of Dave Ramsey, I have incorporated many of his points and advice into my financial life and have been grateful since. I also speak french; J'ai etudiee le langue pour neuf ans et je suis dan en class de francais maitenant!
